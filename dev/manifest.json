Still need work though, but it's a start.\n\n`fix`: **Don't append list values to existing list**:\n\n- Don't append list values to the existing list, but instead replace the entire list with a new list, making sure the default option is also included.\n\n`chore`: **Update settings page (take 2)**:\n\n- Readjusted defaults for 3rd party provider IDs.\n\n- Added shoko as a description source you can toggle.\n\n`feat`: **Add expert mode toggle**.\n\n`refactor`: **Modernize scheduled tasks + more**:\n\n- Modernized the scheduled tasks by updating to more modern syntax.\n\n- Added expert mode toggles to some scheduled tasks, since not all tasks are equal, and some require extra care when running and/or shouldn't be ran on a whim. \ud83d\ude14\n\n`chore`: **Make usage tracker injectable**.\n\n`feat`: **Allow VFS to live in cache dir**:\n\n- Add a new **EXPERIMENTAL** option to place the VFS root directory in the cache directory instead of the config directory. Untested. Also haven't investigated if Jellyfin will auto-clear it yet or if it will leave it be.\n\n`misc`: **Tweak log level of some tasks**.\n\n`fix`: **Don't show 'settings saved' message**:\n\n- Don't show the 'Settings Saved' message when we sign-in and when we toggle expert mode.\n\n`fix`: **Add connected/reset messages**:\n\n- Added a alert/toast for establishing and resetting the connection to Shoko.\n\n`fix`: **Only add extras for movies if the movie will exist**.\n\n`feat`: **Add EXPERIMENTAL physical roots for VFS**:\n\n- Added a new EXPERIMENTAL feature to attach a physical VFS root as a media folder to each of your libraries, allowing us to mount the VFS to the new root and to re-use media folders across libraries without resorting to _other_ workarounds.\n\n`misc`: **Fix up error message**.\n\n`misc`: **Also mark season ordering as expert**.",
