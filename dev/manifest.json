Oh, and the timeout before clearing the cache is configurable in the XML for advanced users btw. \ud83d\ude09\n\n- Remove the auto clear cache task, since it's not needed anymore.\n\n- Removed all unneeded comments from all tasks.\n\n`refactor`: **Add remaining tag sources + more**:\n\n- Added the remaining tag sources, and new inclusion/exclusion filters for abstract tags and/or weighted tags.\n\n- Internally the filtering have been rewritten to use attributes on the tag sources instead of hard coding all the paths. This makes it easier to maintain in the long run.\n\n`cleanup`: **Style fixes**:\n\n- Remove brackets on singular blocks in id lookup.\n\n- Use more `var` in guarded memory cache.\n\n- Fix bracket position in content rating.",

Use at your own discretion. \ud83d\ude42\n\n    To set an override you will simply assign it one of the following custom user tags;\n\n    - `series type/tv` \u2192 `TV`\n    - `series type/tvspecial` \u2192 `TVSpecial`\n    - `series type/tvspecials` \u2192 `TVSpecial`\n    - `series type/tv special` \u2192 `Series`\n    - `series type/tv specials` \u2192 `Series`\n    - `series type/web` \u2192 `Web`\n    - `series type/movie` \u2192 `Movie`\n    - `series type/movies` \u2192 `Movie`\n    - `series type/ova` \u2192 `OVA`\n    - `series type/ovas` \u2192 `OVA`\n    - `series type/other` \u2192 `Other`\n    - `series type/others` \u2192 `Other`\n\n    The tags are case insensitive, and the trailing 's' is optional in case you want to use plural form for the tag. Setting multiple tags will make it set the type from the first assigned tag, but it won't break anything.\n\n`fix`: **Fix ending date for shows with \"unaired\" seasons in them.**.",

                "changelog": "refactor: overhaul tag internals + add content ratings\n\n- Overhauled the internals for how we processed tags. We now use the tag hierarchy to filter it locally instead of the flat lists used on the Shoko Server side, which allows us to avoid magical numbers and also gives us more control when searching for tags in the hierarchy.\n\n- Custom tag support have also been overhauled to support a _fake_ hierarchy by using `/` (forward slash) as a separator between levels in the tag name. All top level custom tags without \"child\" tags are added to the list if custom tags have been enabled, while all tags in the second level or below are treated as if they are of the AniDB hierarchy and will follow the other enabled/disabled tag sources, e.g. if you enable \"elements\" tags then it will also affect any custom tags starting with \"elements/\". This overhauled support for custom tags also allows us to better support the next item on the list.\n\n- Added _assumed_ content ratings based on the AniDB tag hierarchy. This will use the `content indicators` tags and `elements` tags in the hierarchy to make an assumption of the content rating for the AniDB anime using the following content indicators;\n  - TV-G\n  - TV-Y\n  - TV-Y7 (optionally with the FV indicator applied)\n  - TV-PG (optionally with D, L, S, and/or V indicators applied)\n  - TV-14 (optionally with D, L, S, and/or V indicators applied)\n  - TV-MA (optionally with L, S, and/or V indicators applied)\n  - XXX (only for H)\n\n  We also support custom overrides through custom tags in the form of the regular expressions (regex);\n\n  ```txt\n  /^\\/?target audience\\/(?:TV)?[_\\-]?(?:G|Y|Y7|PG|14|MA|XXX)[_\\-]?(FV|D|S|L|V){1,5}$/i\n  ```\n\n  A few examples that all resolve to the `TV-PG` rating if you can't read regex;\n  - `target audience/TV-PG` \u2192 `TV-PG`\n  - `Target Audience/TV-PG-DV` \u2192 `TV-PG` + `D` & `V` indicators applied\n  - `Target Audience/TV_PG_ld` \u2192 `TV-PG` + `D` & `L` indicators applied\n  - `/target audience/pgV` \u2192 `TV-PG` + `V` indicator applied\n  - `/TARGET AUDIENCE/tvPGsl` \u2192 `TV-PG` + `L` & `S` indicators applied\n\n  Where you will override the content rating for the series if the custom tag is applied in Shoko Server/Shoko Desktop.\n\n- Added production locations based on the AniDB tag hierarchy. This is much simpler, as it's a 1:N mapping for the relevant AniDB tags to production locations.\n\n- Overhauled the settings page to accommodate the new settings added in this commit under the Metadata section while also removing the old Tags section. In case it wasn't obvious, **THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE**. \ud83d\ude42\n\n**Note**: TMDB content ratings and production locations will be usable when when the data is available in Shoko Server.\n\nfeat: add automagic season merging\n\n- Added an **EXPERIMENTAL** implementation for automagic season merging. The logic may need to be tweaked further, but for now it needs testing",
