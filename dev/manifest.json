Read the warnings if you want to know more.\n\n`refactor`: **Disable caching of paths again**:\n\n- Disabled the caching of paths in the media folders again, since we once again know that the VFS will only run once for the top-most folder we're scanning.\n\n`misc`: **Update comment**.\n\n`fix`: **Throw if we can't find the media folder**:\n\n- Throw if we can't find the media folder during scanning for non-VFS libraries, instead of silently continuing while using the root folder (which is not a media folder!).\n\n- Added doc-comments for the find media folder and strip media folder methods.\n\n`fix`: **Add better removal of symbolic links in event dispatcher**.",
