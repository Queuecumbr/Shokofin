Oh, and the timeout before clearing the cache is configurable in the XML for advanced users btw. \ud83d\ude09\n\n- Remove the auto clear cache task, since it's not needed anymore.\n\n- Removed all unneeded comments from all tasks.\n\n`refactor`: **Add remaining tag sources + more**:\n\n- Added the remaining tag sources, and new inclusion/exclusion filters for abstract tags and/or weighted tags.\n\n- Internally the filtering have been rewritten to use attributes on the tag sources instead of hard coding all the paths.
