Oh, and the timeout before clearing the cache is configurable in the XML for advanced users btw. \ud83d\ude09\n\n- Remove the auto clear cache task, since it's not needed anymore.\n\n- Removed all unneeded comments from all tasks.\n\n`refactor`: **Add remaining tag sources + more**:\n\n- Added the remaining tag sources, and new inclusion/exclusion filters for abstract tags and/or weighted tags.\n\n- Internally the filtering have been rewritten to use attributes on the tag sources instead of hard coding all the paths. This makes it easier to maintain in the long run.\n\n`cleanup`: **Style fixes**:\n\n- Remove brackets on singular blocks in id lookup.\n\n- Use more `var` in guarded memory cache.\n\n- Fix bracket position in content rating.",
